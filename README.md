* Ethernaut challenges, completed using eth-brownie 
** (and a little web3.py)

Also completed on Ethernaut's site itself, using the browser and dev console, with the following testnet wallet address on Goerli:
0x4AfA03ED8ca5972404b6bDC16Bea62b77Cf9571b

Several of the files are just development / works in progress.  

The real local proofs that utilize Brownie are in the tests.  Otherwise, I worked through it on Ethernaut site itself using a variety of means (e.g., Remix and some Solidity or Python in the scripts directory here).
